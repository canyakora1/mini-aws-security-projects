## Project Description ##

Enabling MFA for one account is a simple process, and setup on the root account typically only takes a few minutes. But what about large-scale administration of MFA? Centralized provisioning and management can be tedious and scales poorly. Even so, the value of MFA-secured access demands a workable approach for securing your AWS assets.

This post will display ways of granting your corporate users access to manage their own MFA devices, and not allowing tem access to any pre-assigned AWS resources until they are fully authenticated with MFA.

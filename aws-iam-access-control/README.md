## Identity and Access Management ##
This mini project on IAM would focus mainly on how to configure access management, troubleshoot identity access and analyze a typical IAM policies.

## Getting Started ##
I wil be providing a simple network diagram that consists of different identities and/or resources that would need the required permissions/roles to communicate to other resources. Feel free to use the diagrams provided or draw up any other one to meet your specific needs.

## Prerequisities ##
An AWS Account with full admin privileges (much likely not root) because we will be deploying some AWS resources and setting up a IAM Role.

## Key Concepts Used ##

**Define Requirements:** 
The first step is to define the requirements of your IAM implementation, such as which users or groups need access to which resources, and what actions they should be allowed to perform.

**Create IAM Users and Groups:** 
You can create IAM users and groups in the IAM console, and assign them specific permissions to access AWS resources.

**Create IAM Roles:** 
IAM roles are another way to manage permissions, and allow you to grant temporary access to resources for users or services.

**Use IAM Policies:** 
IAM policies define the permissions for users, groups, and roles. You can create custom policies to grant specific access to resources or actions, or use pre-defined policies to simplify the process.

**Implement Multi-factor Authentication (MFA):** 
MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication, such as a token or SMS message, in addition to their password.

**Monitor IAM Activity:** 
IAM provides logs that can be used to monitor user activity and detect unauthorized access attempts or other security issues. You can also enable CloudTrail to track all API calls made to IAM and other AWS services.

**Implement IAM Best Practices:** 
Finally, it's important to follow IAM best practices to ensure your implementation is secure and effective. This includes things like regularly reviewing and rotating access keys, using least privilege access, and implementing password policies.

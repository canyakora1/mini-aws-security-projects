# Implementing a cost effective Cloud-native SIEM Solution in AWS
Building a comprehensive SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) solution on AWS involves combining various AWS services to monitor and respond to security events across different layers. Here's a high-level architecture for your SIEM solution:

## Network Security Monitoring ##

- Use Amazon VPC Flow Logs to capture network traffic metadata.
- Stream VPC Flow Logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs or Amazon S3 for storage and analysis.
- Set up CloudWatch Alarms to detect unusual traffic patterns.
- The use of security groups to protect the instance(s) from unauthorized access.

## Infrastructure monitoring with ##
- Use AWS Cloudtrail to capture API calls made on your account.
- Stream CloudTrail Logs to CloudWatch Logs or S3.
- Create Cloudtrail Alerms for specific API acivity or suspicious behavior.
- Use AWS Config to assess and audit the configuration of your AWS account. 

**Operating system logs**: These logs can be forwarded to an s3 bucket and Athena can be used to run queries, also these logs can also forwarded to Cloudwatch Logs Insight or third party solutions like Splunk.

**AWS Config rules:** Used to monitor changes in security groups, new Instance Lauch and also route tables addition.

**Amazon Instances:** focuses on EC2 instances vulnerabilities: By detcting vulnerable OS libraries
Unencrypted network traffic unused TCP listeners

## Application Security Monitoring ##

- implement Amazon GuardDuty to analyze AWS CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs, and DNS logs for potential threats.
- Set up GuardDuty to alert on findings like compromised instances, malicious IP addresses, and many more.
- Integrate Amazon CloudWatch Events with GuardDuty findings to trigger automated reponses.

**CloudWatch logs:** Contains logs coming in from;   Lambda Execution, EC2 Application, ECS/EKS Container logs.

**Cloudtrail logs:** Can also be used for logging events from; Cognito User Authentication logs, Step Functions, Deployments via CodeDeploy.

## Account Security Montoring ##

- Implement AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) Access Analyzer to continuously analyze permissions granted to resources and identify unintended access.
- Use AWS Trusted Advisor to identify and address security vulnerabilities.

**AWS Config rules:** Can also determine whether Cloudtrail was been enabled, IAM User Key has been rotated or whether there are rotations in place the Root User MFA is enabled.

## Data protection monitoring ##
- Implement AWS Key Management Service (KMS) for encryption of sensitive data.
- Set up Amazon Macie to automatically discover, classify, and protect sensitive data.
- Use Amazon CloudWatch Events to respond to data access and protection events.

## Centralized Logging and Analysis ##
- Use Amazon CloudWatch Logs for collecting logs from various sources.
- Utilize Amazon Elasticsearch or a third-party tool like Splunk or Sumo Logic for log analysis, searching, and visualization.

## Incident Response and Automation: ##

- Create AWS Lambda functions to automate responses to specific security events.
- Use Amazon CloudWatch Events to trigger Lambda functions in response to specific events.
- Implement AWS Systems Manager Automation to respond to incidents, such as quarantining compromised instances.

## Monitoring and Alerting: ##

- Set up CloudWatch Alarms, Amazon SNS notifications, or integration with third-party tools for real-time alerts.
- Configure Amazon CloudWatch Dashboards for centralized monitoring.

## Data Retention and Compliance: ##

- Implement data retention policies using Amazon S3 lifecycle policies and Amazon Glacier for long-term storage.
- Ensure compliance with regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, etc.
